    <h1>Writing HTML in HTML</h1>   
    <p><i>Published on</i> 2019-06-19</p>
    <p>I've just the final rewrite of my website. I'm not lying: this is the last time i'm ever going to do it. This website hass gone through countless rewrite - from PHP to wordpress to jekyll to multiple static site generators of my own - but this is the final one. I know so, because i've found the ultimate method for writing webpages: <b>pure HTML.</b> </p>
    <p>It sounds obious, but when you think about how many static site generatorsare being released every day - <a href="#">the list</a> is practically endless - it's far from obvious. Drew Devault recently <a href="#">Challenged</a> people to create their own blog, and didn't even mention the fact that one could write it in pure HTML:</p>
    <p>If you want a hosted platform, I recommend write.as. if you're technical, you could builr your own blog with jekyll or Hugo. Github offers free hosting for jekyll-based blogs.</p>
    <p>Now, there's nothing wrong with jekyll or Hugo; it's just interesting that HTML doesn't even get a mention. and of course, i'm not criticizing Drew; i think the work he's doing is great. But, just like me and you, he is a child of his time.</p>
    <p>That's why i'm writing this blog post - to turn the tide just a little bit.</p><br>
    <h3>So what are the benefits of writing HTML in HTML</h3><br>
    <p>There's one less level of indirection.</p><br>
    <p>This point is simple, but hugely important.</p>
    <p>Using a static site generator means that you have to keep track of two sources: the actual markdown source and the resulting HTML source. This may not sound too difficult, but always having to make sure that these two source are in line with each other takes a mentall toll. Now, when i write in HTML, i only have to keep track of one source.</p>
    <p>Further, you actually need to have your static site generator installed. Again, not a huge thing, but if you often switch between different operating system, this is yet another chore. with HTML, you just need a web broswer - which, if you're creating a website, you need anyway!</p>
